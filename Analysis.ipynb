    "## Description and Datasets\n",
    "This project analyzes neighborhood-level metrics by combining multiple datasets. It focuses on evaluating land acreage, total deaths, employment statistics, and K-12 school enrollment to identify trends or patterns across neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Datasets Used**\n",
    "1. `land.csv` - Contains neighborhood acreage data.\n",
    "2. `medianagedeath.csv` - Reports total deaths by neighborhood.\n",
    "3. `employment.csv` - Includes employment estimates by neighborhood.\n",
    "4. `school_enrollment.csv` - Contains K-12 student enrollment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Repository Contents**\n",
    "- **`final-project.ipynb`**: The main notebook consolidating all the data analysis and results.\n",
    "- **`points_merged.ipynb`**: Intermediate processing of combined datasets.\n",
    "- **`ranked_merged.ipynb`**: Focused analysis for ranking neighborhoods.\n",
    "- **Data Files**:\n",
    "   - `land.csv`  \n",
    "   - `medianagedeath.csv`  \n",
    "   - `employment.csv`  \n",
    "   - `school_enrollment.csv`  \n",
    "- **Output Files**:\n",
    "   - `ranked_points.csv` - Ranked neighborhoods based on acreage and deaths.\n",
    "   - `percent_points.csv` - Percentage-based points for employment and K-12 enrollment.\n",
    "   - `total_points.csv` - Final combined points for all metrics.\n",
    "- **`maps.jpg`**: Visual asset for geographic reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This repository integrates neighborhood-level data to rank and evaluate various metrics, such as:\n",
    "- **Land Size** (acres)\n",
    "- **Total Deaths** per neighborhood\n",
    "- **Employment** levels\n",
    "- **K-12 School Enrollment**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses Python with **pandas** for data processing and outputs useful insights into neighborhood trends.\n"
